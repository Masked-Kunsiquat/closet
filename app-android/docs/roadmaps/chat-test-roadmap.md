# Chat Enhancement — Test Coverage Roadmap

Tests for the completed phases of `chat-enhance-roadmap.md` (Phases 1–3).  
Target: **0.7.1**. No new Gradle dependencies required — MockK, Turbine, and `coroutines-test` are already in `libs.versions.toml`.

## Files to create

```

## 1 — `ChatResponseParserTest`

Pure logic, no Android or GMS dependencies. Highest value per line of test code.

### JSON extraction (`extractJson`)

- [ ] Plain `{…}` — returned as-is
- [ ] Markdown-fenced ` ```json\n{…}\n``` ` — inner block extracted
- [ ] Markdown fence without `json` tag — inner block extracted
- [ ] Prose with embedded `{…}` — outermost braces extracted
- [ ] No `{…}` found — original string returned (parse failure surfaced by caller)

### `text` type

- [ ] Valid `{"type":"text","text":"hello"}` → `ChatResponse.Text("hello")`
- [ ] Missing `text` field → `Result.failure`
- [ ] Missing `type` field → `Result.failure`

### `items` type

- [ ] Valid with `item_ids` → `ChatResponse.WithItems` with correct IDs
- [ ] Missing `item_ids` → `Result.failure`
- [ ] Empty `item_ids` → `Result.failure`
- [ ] Non-long entry in `item_ids` → `Result.failure`

### `outfit` type

- [ ] Valid with 2–4 IDs and `reason` → `ChatResponse.WithOutfit`
- [ ] 1 ID → `Result.failure` (too few)
- [ ] 5 IDs → `Result.failure` (too many)
- [ ] Missing `reason` → `Result.failure`
- [ ] Blank `reason` → `Result.failure`
- [ ] Missing `item_ids` → `Result.failure`

### Unknown type

- [ ] `{"type":"unknown","text":"hi"}` → `ChatResponse.Text("hi")` (graceful fallback)
- [ ] Future type `"widget"` with valid `text` → `ChatResponse.Text`

### Action parsing — `log_outfit`

- [ ] Accepted on `outfit` parent with 2–4 IDs → `ChatAction.LogOutfit`
- [ ] Rejected on `items` parent → `action = null`, parent response still succeeds
- [ ] 1 ID → `action = null`
- [ ] 5 IDs → `action = null`
- [ ] Missing `item_ids` in action block → `action = null`

### Action parsing — `open_item`

- [ ] Valid `item_id` → `ChatAction.OpenItem(id)`
- [ ] Missing `item_id` → `action = null`
- [ ] `item_id` is a string, not a number → `action = null`

### Action parsing — `open_recommendations`

- [ ] `{"type":"open_recommendations"}` → `ChatAction.OpenRecommendations`
- [ ] Accepted on both `items` and `outfit` parent types

### Action parsing — error isolation

- [ ] Unknown action type → `action = null`, parent response still succeeds
- [ ] Malformed action block (invalid JSON fragment) → `action = null`, parent still succeeds
- [ ] Missing `action` field entirely → `action = null`

---

## 2 — `RegexDateParserTest`

`regexParseDate()` is an `internal fun` in `RegexDateParser.kt` — no mocking needed.

### ISO dates

- [ ] `"2026-04-04"` → `"2026-04-04"`
- [ ] ISO date embedded in a sentence → extracted correctly
- [ ] Malformed ISO-looking string `"2026-13-01"` → `null` (invalid date)

### Month Day patterns

- [ ] `"April 4"` → `"2026-04-04"` (current year assumed)
- [ ] `"April 4th"` → `"2026-04-04"` (ordinal suffix stripped)
- [ ] `"Apr 4"` → `"2026-04-04"` (abbreviated month)
- [ ] `"april 4, 2025"` → `"2025-04-04"` (explicit year used)
- [ ] All 12 full month names → correct month number
- [ ] All abbreviated month names → correct month number
- [ ] `"April 31"` → `null` (invalid day for month)

### Unhandled patterns (must return `null`)

- [ ] `"yesterday"`
- [ ] `"last Monday"`
- [ ] `"3 days ago"`
- [ ] Blank string
- [ ] Garbage input `"wear count"`

---

## 3 — `ChatViewModelTest`

Follows the `StatsViewModelTest` pattern: MockK + Turbine + `UnconfinedTestDispatcher`.

Fake `ChatRepository` with a `mockk` that returns configurable `Result<ChatResponse>`.  
Fake `ClothingDao.getItemDetailsByIds()` returning empty list (no image lookups needed).  
Fake `StorageRepository` and `EmbeddingIndex` as no-ops.

### Message flow

- [ ] `sendMessage()` with blank input → no state change, no repository call
- [ ] `sendMessage()` while `isLoading = true` → no-op (second call ignored)
- [ ] Successful response → `Thinking` placeholder replaced by assistant message; `isLoading = false`
- [ ] Failed response → `Thinking` replaced by `ChatMessage.Assistant.Error`; `isLoading = false`
- [ ] Failed response → `isLoading = false` (loading not stuck)

### History — Phase 1

- [ ] Successful `Text` response → `history` gains 2 turns (user + assistant)
- [ ] Failed response → `history` unchanged
- [ ] After 3 successful exchanges → history has 6 turns
- [ ] After 4th successful exchange → history still 6 turns (oldest pair dropped)
- [ ] History snapshot taken before launch (in-flight message not in snapshot)

### History — Phase 2 stat responses

- [ ] `WithStat` response → `history` **not** updated
- [ ] Follow-up after a stat → history still reflects only non-stat turns

### `clearChat()`

- [ ] `messages` list reset to empty
- [ ] `history` reset (subsequent send passes empty history to repository)
- [ ] `inputText` cleared

### `toAssistantMessage()` mapping

- [ ] `ChatResponse.Text` → `ChatMessage.Assistant.Text`
- [ ] `ChatResponse.WithItems` with action → `ChatMessage.Assistant.WithItems` with action preserved
- [ ] `ChatResponse.WithOutfit` with action → `ChatMessage.Assistant.WithOutfit` with action preserved
- [ ] `ChatResponse.WithStat` → `ChatMessage.Assistant.WithStat`

## 4 — `ChatRouterPatternTest`

The full-flavor `ChatRouter` calls `LanguageIdentification.getClient()` at construction time, which requires GMS. Two layers to test without instrumented setup:

**Layer A — FOSS stub**: trivial but worth having as a smoke test.

- [ ] FOSS `ChatRouter.route(anyString)` always returns `Unrouted`

**Layer B — Regex/pattern helpers** (full flavor): the companion `val` patterns are accessible directly. Test them without constructing `ChatRouter`.

### `ITEM_NAME_PATTERN`

- [ ] `"how many times have i worn my grey blazer"` → captures `"grey blazer"`
- [ ] `"how many times worn my black jeans?"` → captures `"black jeans"`
- [ ] `"wear count for the white shirt"` → captures `"white shirt"`
- [ ] Query with no item name → no match

### `DAYS_PATTERN`

- [ ] `"30 days"` → count 30, unit days → 30
- [ ] `"2 weeks"` → count 2, unit weeks → 14
- [ ] `"1 week"` → 7
- [ ] `"lately"` → no match (falls back to `DEFAULT_UNWORN_DAYS`)

### `WORE_ON_INTERROGATIVE_PATTERN`

- [ ] `"what did i wore on tuesday"` → matches
- [ ] `"what goes with what i wore on tuesday"` — gap between `what` and `i` is > 15 chars → no match (false-positive guard)

### Pattern priority (never-worn before not-worn-since)

- [ ] `"what have i never worn"` matches `matchesNeverWorn`, not `matchesNotWornSince`
  - Verify by checking only `matchesNeverWorn` returns true and `matchesNotWornSince` returns false for this input

---

## Pitfalls

- **`LanguageIdentification.getClient()` in `ChatRouter` constructor** — do not instantiate full-flavor `ChatRouter` in unit tests. Test patterns via companion vals and test routing behaviour through `ChatRepository` with a mocked router instead.
- **`embeddingIndex.size`** — `ChatViewModel` reads this at construction; stub it to return `> 0` to put the UI into the ready state by default.
- **History is `private`** — assert indirectly: after a known number of sends, check the `history` list passed to the mock repository on the next `sendMessage()` call via `verify { repo.query(any(), capture(slot)) }`.
